#Dictionary

Tired of that old boring Weber Dictionary? Well this application was designed for users who are interested in building their very own dictionary! There are no rules to what you can put in as words and definitions!  

## Installation


Retrieve the included Gemfile and Run the following command
```
bundle install
```

## Usage

To use the app run
```
ruby app.rb
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:4567. In the forms provided, input the word you would like to
add to your own dictionary. After adding to dictionary you can click on the word you added and the next page shows the details about the word. On that page you can hit "add definition" and that will allow you to define the word and update your dictionary.

You may also access this app from Heroku @ https://james-dictionary.herokuapp.com.
